## What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[2] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools

## History of FLask
Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004. According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious application. The name is a play on the earlier Bottle framework.

When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created a bulletin board system written in Python, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.

In April 2016, the Pocoo team was disbanded and development of Flask and related libraries passed to the newly formed Pallets project.

Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of October 2020, it has second most stars on GitHub among Python web-development frameworks, only slightly behind Django,and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey 2018
